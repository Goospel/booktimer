# remove-worktree.ps1 - safely remove a git worktree, cutting the node_modules junction FIRST.
#
# Why: a worktree's frontend/node_modules is a Windows JUNCTION pointing at the MAIN
#   worktree's node_modules (see link-node-modules.ps1, learning-notes N-132). A plain
#   `git worktree remove` / rm -rf follows that junction and DELETES THE TARGET's contents
#   (main node_modules emptied 137 -> 0, troubleshooting T-110). This script cuts the
#   junction LINK ONLY (target preserved) before removing the worktree, so the main repo
#   keeps its dependencies.
#
# Guards (refuse with exit 3): non-existent path, not a worktree root, the MAIN worktree,
#   a path not registered as a worktree of this repo, or a current directory inside the
#   target (you cannot delete the folder your shell stands in).
#
# After removal it also fast-forwards the MAIN worktree's main branch (git pull), so the
# local main catches up to the merge that just landed on origin. This is best-effort and
# only runs when the main worktree is idle on main and clean (see step 10); -NoPull skips it.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -File .claude/scripts/remove-worktree.ps1 <worktree-path>
#   ... -DryRun       show what would happen, change nothing
#   ... -Force        pass --force to git worktree remove (dirty/untracked worktree)
#   ... -KeepBranch   do not delete the local branch after removing
#   ... -NoPull       do not fast-forward the main worktree's main after removal
#
# Run this from OUTSIDE the target worktree (e.g. the main worktree).
# Exit: 0 ok, 2 usage, 3 guard violation, 1 git failure.
